# **Internal Users Management System**

## **Overview :**

The internal users management system is a secure, scalable, and enterprise-grade backend application built with Spring Boot.
This microservice is responsible for managing core employee-related operations within the organization. It handles the complete lifecycle of internal users, including:
* User creation and role assignment
* Department management
* Payroll calculation
* Employee resignation processing

The system ensures structured **role-based access control**, secure authentication, and compliance with organizational policies.
The project follows Clean Architecture principles, industry best practices, and a layered backend structure to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## **Architecture :**

* Controller Layer → Handles REST API requests
* Service Layer → Business logic & validations
* Repository Layer → Data persistence with JPA
* Security Layer → Authentication & role-based authorization

It also includes :

* DTO layer
* Exception handling layer
* Security filters
* Mapper layer
* Utility layer
* Infrastructure layer (Docker)

This architecture ensures :
* Separation of concerns
* Maintainability
* Scalability
* Clean code structure

## **Security :**
* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Endpoint protection (not public should have a valid JWT)
* Secure authentication via Spring Security
* Validation of business rules before persistence
* Restricted access to sensitive operations

## **Prerequisites :**

* JDK 21
* Maven 3.3.4
* PostgreSQL 16

## **How to Run :**

1. Clone the repository : **git clone https://gitlab.com/woridgesaas/employe/ms-internal-users-management.git**
2. Build the project : **mvn clean install**
3. Run the application : **mvn spring-boot:run** or run the packaged JAR: **java -jar
   target/attendance-management-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar**

## **Testing :**

Run all tests using : **mvn test**

## **API Base URL :**
* http://localhost:8081/api

## **CI/CD Pipeline :**

This project uses GitLab CI/CD to automate the build, test, and release process following a GitFlow workflow. The pipeline ensures that:
* Every branch is validated
* Only stable code from main generates a release artifact
* Sprint releases are safely stored

## **Pipeline Stages :**

The pipeline consists of three stages : **build → test → package**

#### **1. Build Stage :**

* Compiles the project using Maven (**mvn clean compile**)
* Ensures the code compiles successfully
* Runs on all branches
* Stores temporary build artifacts for internal use

**Purpose :**
Detect compilation errors early and validate project structure.

#### **2. Test Stage :**

* Executes unit tests (**mvn test**)
* Uses compiled output from the build stage
* Runs on all branches

**Purpose:**
Validate business logic and prevent regressions.

#### **3. Package Stage :**

* Generates the final executable .jar file (**mvn package -DskipTests**)

Runs only when:
* A Merge Request targets the main branch or a commit is pushed directly to main
* Produces a permanent release artifact : **attendance-management-release**

**Purpose :**
Ensure that only stable and validated code produces official application releases.

## **Performance Optimization :**
The pipeline includes :
* Maven dependency caching (**.m2/repository**)
* Artifact reuse between stages (**needs**)
* Controlled artifact retention policy

This improves build performance and ensures efficient CI execution.
